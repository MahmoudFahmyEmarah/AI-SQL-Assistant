# Roadmap for STC SQL Assistant

## Overview

The STC SQL Assistant is an innovative application designed to assist data engineers and developers in SQL query development using Generative AI and vector databases. The application will feature multiple modes, including SQL syntax checking, natural language to SQL translation, query optimization, and result visualization. It will be compatible with popular database technologies and environments, providing an end-to-end solution for SQL development.

## Features

1. **SQL Syntax Checker**
   - Validate SQL query syntax.
   - Recommend corrected SQL queries.
   - Provide detailed explanations for syntax errors.

2. **Natural Language to SQL Translation (Seq-to-SQL)**
   - Translate natural language prompts into SQL queries.
   - Use database schema and metadata to enhance accuracy.
   - Leverage vector databases for schema embedding and context retrieval.

3. **SQL Query Optimizer**
   - Optimize user-provided SQL queries.
   - Generate optimized SQL queries based on natural language prompts.
   - Compare optimized and non-optimized queries with performance insights.

4. **Target Database Technology Selection**
   - Support database technologies like Teradata, PostgreSQL, Hive, MySQL, etc.
   - Adjust query generation and optimization based on the selected technology.

5. **Environment Configuration**
   - Configure connection strings for environments (Dev, Test, Pre-Prod, Prod).
   - Validate connectivity based on the chosen environment.

6. **Query Recommendation**
   - Generate three recommended solutions for each query mode.
   - Allow users to select or execute any of the solutions.

7. **Query Step-by-Step Execution**
   - Break down SQL queries into components.
   - Allow users to preview intermediate results for each step.
   - Test queries with a limited number of rows (e.g., 100).

8. **Result Insights and Visualization**
   - Provide insights and explanations for query results.
   - Dynamically generate suitable visualizations based on the result set.

## Technical Stack

1. **Generative AI**
   - Initial use of OpenAI API.
   - Explore open-source LLMs (e.g., GPT-NeoX, LLaMA) for long-term scalability.

2. **Vector Database**
   - Store schema and metadata embeddings (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate, or Milvus).
   - Enable RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for precise context provision.

3. **Frontend**
   - Framework: Flutter (cross-platform compatibility).
   - UI/UX: Intuitive design for SQL professionals and beginners.

4. **Backend**
   - Language: Python (FastAPI or Flask for APIs).
   - Database: PostgreSQL (for storing user preferences and query logs).

5. **Deployment**
   - Cloud-based solution for scalability (AWS, GCP, or Azure).
   - Secure integration with target databases via APIs or ODBC/JDBC drivers.
